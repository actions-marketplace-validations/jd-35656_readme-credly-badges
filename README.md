## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Add Credly Badges to Your README

### 1. Add Badge Markers to Your Markdown

Insert the following comment block in your `README.md` or any other markdown
file where you want the badges to appear:

```md
<!-- START CREDLY BADGES -->
<!-- END CREDLY BADGES -->
```

The GitHub Action will replace the content between these markers with
up-to-date badge information.

### 2. Add the GitHub Action Workflow

Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/update-badges.yaml` with this
minimal setup:
